looking at lightning strikes on a per-county basis in the US. Cleaning code available here. Analysis and figures will hopefully be uploaded in November/December.


I found some great data on NOAA's website on lightning strikes per county per day (https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/reports/county/byName/) going back like, super far. Lightning has a ton of endogeneity problems but let's see what kind of trouble I can get into.
